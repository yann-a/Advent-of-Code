# Advent of Code

My Advent of code submissions, using python to retrieve inputs and submit answers.  
I usually tidy up my solutions before pushing here but I don't modify the implementation itself, so some of them are optimized for code writing time rather than runtime.

I got points on the global leaderboard a few times, totalling:  
* **2022:** 109 points  
* **2024:** 24 points

## How to run the scripts

- Use `pip install --editable .` in the root directory, then run any script you want the normal way, e.g `python3 2022/18/main.py`.

## How to use the code for your own submissions

- Retrieve your AOC cookie by logging in on the website, and replace it in secret.py.

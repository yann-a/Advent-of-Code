# Advent of Code

My Advent of code submissions, using python to retrieve inputs and submit answers.

## How to run the scripts

- Use `pip install --editable .` in the root directory, then run any script you want the normal way, e.g `python3 2022/18/main.py`.

## How to use the code for your own submissions

- Retrieve your AOC cookie by logging in on the website, and replace it in secret.py.
